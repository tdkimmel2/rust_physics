## Physics in Rust Library

Handy physics library that I'll add to as I make projects.

# Spinors
Spinors were created to be used to draw them and visualize how they transform under local phase transformations mostly.

# Pauli Matrices
Pauli matrices were made for the spinor project, very minimal as it's just getter functions for the matrices.
